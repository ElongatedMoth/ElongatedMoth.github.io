        <h1>Essay</h1>
        <p>New York City has many places where you can go to bond with family and friends, and which can provide you with stories and memories that you can tell others when you see them.  Most of these places have stories of their own and get more interesting as you visit them over and over.  One of these places is The White Horse Tavern.  Located at 567 Hudson Street in Manhattan, The White Horse Tavern has been a place for people to connect, bond, and make stories or memories for many years.  When it was founded in 1880 it was originally a longshoreman's bar.  It was a place where people could rest and relax after a long day of loading and unloading ships at the docks.  It is during this time period that it became a popular stot.  It was known to gather large crowds and had immense parties to celebrate almost anything. Though the stories may not have been as legendary as when it became a beatnik writers’ bar, it did serve as a place for people to unwind and connect.  During this time period, there were many people who needed a place like this in order to meet new friends or to help get through a tough day.
        </p>
        <p>The stories only got more legendary when, in the early 20th century, it became a writers hangout.  During this time the Tavern's popularity boomed as writers and poets from all across the country came to visit, chat, write, debate, and create stories in the historic place.  Some stories of this era include when Dylan Thomas, the famous beatnik writer who wrote many famous poems, drank himself to death right in the middle of the bar.  He collapsed after he drank his 21st glass of whiskey, and to think the bartender was probably already pouring his 22nd glass and hoping for a large tip when he collapsed dead on the floor.  His portrait still hangs above his usual sitting spot. Now not only does The White Horse Tavern hold many stories, but it also became a popular spot for writers to share, develop and visualize their stories.  Some famous writers/poets that frequinted that spot were Al Ginsburg, John Ashberry, Frank O’Hara, and Jack Kerouac, who was famously thrown out of the bar on multiple occasions  In fact, there is even a sign in the bathroom that says “JACK GO HOME!”.   As years went by, the stories and the people that the Tavern has seen just grew and grew.
        </p>
        <p>After the age of writing slowly faded out, the Tavern became more of a neighborhood hangout.  It was a place that allowed many people to bond and share their stories over pints of beer and weirdly good bar food.  Though as times and ownership changed, the Tavern took a turn for the worse as the new owner started to target younger people, instead of catering to the already large assortment of characters of every flavor.  During this time period, these changes upset the locals, who treated the Tavern as a second home, as they watched the “old” Tavern disappear before their eyes.  The Tavern was replaced by a health hazard mob scene as the pandemic rolled in.  
        </p>
        <p>I was sad to hear about this change as it was a regular hangout when my family came to NYC from Buffalo.  I remember my cousins and I were always separated from the grown-ups and forced to sit at other tables as we wolfed down burgers and fries and kept asking for chocolate milkshakes.  It was also the place I was brought to right after I was born as tons of family members converged on NYC to see me.   Technically, I spent my 5th, 6th and 7th day of my life at the Tavern, sleeping while my family celebrated my birth (and watched football and soccer).   The White Horse Tavern has gone through many different stages, each with their own character and personality, and each with their own stories.   It is a place where stories are made, and old tales are continued, and I hope it remains a place that I can go back to relive these memories as I grow up in NYC.
